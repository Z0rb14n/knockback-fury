# knockback-fury

Game by a Summer 2023 UBC Game Dev team.

## Getting Started

This game uses the Unity Editor version 2021.3.26f1 - install it from Unity Hub.
Clone the repository, then in Unity Hub: Open > Add project from disk to add the cloned repository to the list of projects and open the project.

## General Stylistic Things

I'd generally advise following this style guide: https://unity.com/how-to/naming-and-code-style-tips-c-scripting-unity with a few notes or changes:
- Use underscores on private variables
- Prefer explicit access modifier (use `private` instead of omitting)
